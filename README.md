# CPJ-Autominer
Super simplified script. I saw a handful of projects and just scraped it down to the bare necessity.
Made this for personal use but feel free to run and impliment a different version if you fancy.
Works in Chromium/Google Chrome fully AFK


There's no need for movement to keep generating coins, simply clicking D every couple of minutes will convince the system its a new mining session and you'll continue to generate more coins.

place your character in the mine area and run the script, simple as that.
